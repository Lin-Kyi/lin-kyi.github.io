<small>In computer science, conferences are often the primary venue for publication and are critical for [scientific dissemination](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/conferences-vs-journals.html), with papers undergoing multiple rounds of peer review. One may refer to the [CORE Rankings](https://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal) and the acceptance rate for a general idea of a conference's standing within the computing community.</small>
