## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="lin.png">

Hi! My name is Lin (she/her). I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP) where I am supervised by [Asia Biega](https://asiabiega.github.io/) in the Responsible Computing Group. 

My work sits at the intersection of human-computer interaction, security and privacy, and tech policy. Broadly, I am investigating how we can reimagine notice and consent and move towards sustainable, responsible, and human-centred data collection for users and AI co-generators (such as workers). My research makes the following contributions:
* Understand the consent ecosystem under the GDPR, beyond the user interface;
* Mitigate emerging challenges to consent (i.e., informing consent guidelines for GenAI data collection, and how power influences consent); and
* Use insights from my previous threads of research to develop a collective consent framework to benefit users and workers

My work has garnered interest amongst privacy, and AI ethics stakeholders across Europe and North America such as the _Future of Privacy Forum, French Data Protection Authority (CNIL), UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity, and NOYB_. My work has also won the _Council of Europe's 2024 Rodotà Award_ for an original and innovative contribution to data protection.
