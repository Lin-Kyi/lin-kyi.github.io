## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="lin.png">

Hi! My name is Lin (she/her). I am a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)](https://www.mpi-sp.org/) where I am supervised by [Asia Biega](https://asiabiega.github.io/) in the Responsible Computing Group.  

The goal of my research is to advance responsible data collection practices centered on consent as a foundation for building ethical technologies. My work sits at the intersection of **security and privacy**, **human-computer interaction**, and **tech policy**, and I use qualitative and quantitative HCI research methods. My research makes the following contributions:  
1. **Advance understanding of GDPR consent mechanisms beyond the user interface**: examining legal loopholes to consent, and requirements for informed consent;  
2. **Mitigate emerging challenges to consent**: informing responsible data collection practices for GenAI development; and  
3. **Propose a collective data governance framework for consent** based on insights from 1 and 2 which could give people more leverage over their data in a variety of data governance contexts    

My research has engaged regulators, industry, trade union, privacy NGOs, and AI ethics stakeholders across Europe and North America by challenging conventional notions of consent and responsible data collection, showing that it must extend beyond security + privacy and data protection law. I have presented and discussed my work with: the [Future of Privacy Forum](https://fpf.org/), [French Data Protection Authority (CNIL)](https://www.cnil.fr/en/), [UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/), the [European Trade Union Institute (ETUI)](https://www.etui.org/), the [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai/), the [JP Morgan AI Research Group](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/technology/research/ai), and [NOYB](https://noyb.eu/en). My work has also won the [Council of Europe's 2024 Rodotà Award](https://www.coe.int/en/web/data-protection/2024-rodot%C3%A0-award) for an original and innovative contribution to data protection.  

**I am on the job market this year for tenure-track and post doc positions in information and computer science! If you think I might be a good fit for an opportunity in your department or network, please reach out!**
