## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="lin.png">

Hi! My name is Lin (she/her). I am a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)](https://www.mpi-sp.org/) where I am supervised by [Asia Biega](https://asiabiega.github.io/) in the Responsible Computing Group. 

My work sits at the intersection of security and privacy, human-computer interaction, and tech policy. I use empirical user research methods from human-computer interaction to research how we can move towards more responsible data collection, centered on consent as a foundation for building ethical technologies. My research makes the following contributions:  
1) Improve and understand the consent ecosystem under the GDPR beyond the user interface;  
2) Mitigate emerging challenges to consent (i.e., informing consent and responsible data collection guidelines for GenAI); and  
3) Propose a collective data governance framework for consent based on insights from 1 and 2, which could give people more leverage over their data   

My work has garnered interest amongst privacy, industry, trade union, and AI ethics stakeholders across Europe and North America as my research recognizes the complex, interdisciplinary nature of consent and data governance, especially in the era of (Gen)AI. I have presented and discussed my work with: the [Future of Privacy Forum](https://fpf.org/), [French Data Protection Authority (CNIL)](https://www.cnil.fr/en/), [UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/), the [European Trade Union Institute (ETUI)](https://www.etui.org/), the [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai/), the [JP Morgan AI Research Group](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/technology/research/ai), and [NOYB](https://noyb.eu/en). My work has also won the [Council of Europe's 2024 Rodotà Award](https://www.coe.int/en/web/data-protection/2024-rodot%C3%A0-award) for an original and innovative contribution to data protection.
