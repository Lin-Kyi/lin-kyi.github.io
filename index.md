## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="lin.png">

Hi! My name is Lin (she/her). I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP) where I am supervised by [Asia Biega](https://asiabiega.github.io/) in the Responsible Computing Group. 

My work sits at the intersection of security and privacy, human-computer interaction, and tech policy. I use empirical user research methods from human-computer interaction to research how we can move towards responsible data collection, centered on consent as a foundation for building ethical technologies. My research makes the following contributions:
1. Improve and understand the consent ecosystem under the GDPR beyond the user interface;  
2. Mitigate emerging challenges to consent (i.e., informing consent and responsible data collection guidelines for GenAI); and  
3. Propose a collective data governance framework for consent based on insights from 1 and 2, which could give people more leverage over their data   

My work has garnered interest amongst privacy, and AI ethics stakeholders across Europe and North America such as the _Future of Privacy Forum, French Data Protection Authority (CNIL), UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity_, and _NOYB_. My work has also won the _Council of Europe's 2024 Rodotà Award_ for an original and innovative contribution to data protection.
