**PhDing in Germany**
* I get asked often about what it's like to do a PhD in Germany (specifically at MPI-SP or with my supervisor). Unfortunately I don't have the capacity to do 1:1 calls for each request (unless you've got an offer here), but [this](https://andreas-zeller.info/2020/07/01/whats-it-like-to-be-a-phd-student-in-germany.html) blog post gives a good overview, and I would say the experience at MPI-SP is similar 

**Learning German**
* If you're moving to Germany, forget what you've been told about not needing to know German. You need German to live here comfortably. I have slightly-above-basic German (i.e., enough to do daily tasks, go to appointments in broken German, and understand the gist of spoken German, but am definitely not fluent). The summer before moving to Bochum, I did a [Lingoda Sprint](https://www.lingoda.com/en/sprint/) (and I got my money back!). This intensive course, combined with living in Germany for the past 4 years has helped me get to a slightly-above-basic level of German. However, working in an English-speaking environment and having an international group of friends and colleagues, is it admittedly difficult to progress to full German fluency  
* Other German-learning resources I found helpful (with content that is interesting to watch, i,e., not stuff for children)
   * [Easy German](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyGerman) YouTube channel
   * I tried out [Babbel's live classes](https://www.babbel.com/) for 3 months since it's a good deal. However, as there was no impending doom of losing my money if I missed a class, I found it difficult to keep myself accountable to showing up for these classes
