**How to Pronounce "Kyi"**
* I prefer my last name be pronounced like "key," instead of the way it should be pronounced in Burmese. As Burmese is a tonal language, a different pronounciation of a word can completely change the meaning. In the case of my last name, this mispronounciation is not so flattering, as explained [here](https://school.teachingbooks.net/pronounce.cgi?pid=3560)

**Professional Materials**
* My website is hosted on Github Pages based off of [this](https://github.com/ankitsultana/researcher) template
* My CV is based off of [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/academic-cv-template/hvjpfjnyggbf) template

**PhDing in Germany**
* I get asked often about what it's like to do a PhD in Germany (specifically at MPI-SP or with my supervisor). Unfortunately I don't have the capacity to do 1:1 calls for each request (unless you've got an offer here), but [this](https://andreas-zeller.info/2020/07/01/whats-it-like-to-be-a-phd-student-in-germany.html) blog post gives a good overview, and I would say the experience at MPI-SP is similar.  

**Learning German**
* If you're moving to Germany, forget what you've been told about not needing to know German to get around. You need German to live here comfortably. I have okay-ish German, but am definitely not fluent (i.e., enough to do daily tasks, go to appointments in broken German, and understand the gist of spoken German). The summer before moving to Bochum, I did a [Lingoda Sprint](https://www.lingoda.com/en/sprint/) (and I got my money back!). This intensive course, combined with living in Germany for the past 4 years has helped me get to an okay-ish level of German. However, I work in a fully English-speaking environment and have an international group of friends and colleagues, so is it admittedly difficult to become fluent  
* Other German-learning resources I found helpful (with content that is interesting, i,e., not stuff for children)
   * [Easy German](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyGerman) YouTube channel
   * I tried out [Babbel's live classes](https://www.babbel.com/) for 3 months since it's a good deal. However, as there was no impending doom of losing my money if I missed a class, I found it difficult to keep myself accountable to showing up for these classes  
   * [DW's slowly spoken news](https://learngerman.dw.com/de/langsam-gesprochene-nachrichten/s-60040332)
   * Just doing random things in German, like buying/selling things on [eBay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/), asking for help at a store, listening to the inevitable Deutsche Bahn train announcements (typically announcing a delay or cancellation), and doing stuff related to your hobbies in German can help you learn the language for that specific context
